# Discord Bot - RileyBot
I am currently developing a Discord Bot called RileyBot. This bot at the moment is quite rudimentary, however, features are currently being added. Reccomendations are invited!

## Features:
- Voice Chat Monitor - Displays text to ***#general*** when a user enters or joins a voice chat.
- Live Voting System - Allows users to vote on an arbitrary number of options, this allows a number of members in the server to cast a vote between eachother.
- Fun Fact Generator - Displays a random fun fact, courtery of [RandFacts](https://pypi.org/project/randfacts/)

## Future Features:
- Live Music Bot - Allowing server members to play music via URL or Keyword
- Ticket System - Allowing server administrators an interface to monitor and address member tickets
- Chat Management System - Allowing server administrators to mute/ kick/ ban users, or even remove spam chat
- Lottery/ Raffle System - Allowing server administrators to conduct a lottery for giveaways
